              <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-12">
                This project was my first to involve design thinking structured into mulitple iterative
                steps and lots of critical, creative thinking. We were tasked to design an app icon that
                was reflective of a function based on a subject prompt given to every single student.
                In my case, I had to design an app icon that “intentionally gets you lost”. The primary
                objective of this assignment was to focus on integrating design principles into an
                icon that conveyed the function of the application.

                related to the key words of my concept. I
                had to ensure that the symbolic meaning of
                the icons were reflective of the intentions
                within the app function.
