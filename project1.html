              <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-12">
                This project was my first to involve design thinking structured into mulitple iterative
                steps and lots of critical, creative thinking. We were tasked to design an app icon that
                was reflective of a function based on a subject prompt given to every single student.
                In my case, I had to design an app icon that “intentionally gets you lost”. The primary
                objective of this assignment was to focus on integrating design principles into an
                icon that conveyed the function of the application.

              <h3> Step 1</h3>
              <h4> mindmapping </h4>

              <p> The first step in the iterative process was
                to sketch out anything related to my app
                concept. As someone who was (and is)
                very new to the process of design thinking,
                I wrote down anything that expressed
                emotions, objects and simple notions that
                related to the key words of my concept. I
                had to ensure that the symbolic meaning of
                the icons were reflective of the intentions
                within the app function.

              <h3> Step 2</h3>
              <h4> sketching </h4>

              <p> The second step was involved sketching and
                implementing the key objects and symbols that
                reflected the notions of “getting lost” based on
                the ideas generated from my mindmap.By using
                symbols such as arrows and question marks
                and combining them with other symbolic objects,
                like the compass, my sketches allowed
                me to flush out any over-used icons and vere
                towards an app which was more creative in reflecting
                its vital function.

              <h3> Step 3</h3>
              <h4> refining icons</h4>

              <p> After picking three of my favoruite icons in the
                sketches and refining them, I ran into my first
                problems as a designer. Upon sharing my work
                with others, I was told that the function of the app
                was not entirely reflective of my concept and that
                perhaps by mixing and matching some of the elements
                already present in my icons I’d be able to
                successfully convey the message of getting lost
                intentionally. Though these designs weren’t entirely
                unsuccessful, I knew there was more I
                could do to push forward with the process.

              <h3> Step 4</h3>
              <h4> refining continued</h4>

              <p> This is where the magic began to happen. With
                the help of some peer feedback, I re-mixed the
                original concept of the compass and the man to
                create something more representative of an app
                that intentionally gets you lost. In turn, I felt more
                confident with my design sketches because of
                the direction I was given.

              <p> In the final step there was more to it than just
                simply creating the icon. Instead of sticking to
                my original design sketch, I experimented with
                various stroke weights and gray tones to
                achieve the desired look. I learnt that not every
                design decision has to be explicitly deliberate
                to the viewer but rather gives just enough to
                communicate the message.

              <h3> Evaluation</h3>

              <p> In conclusion, the project was definietly a success as 
                the process of design and iterative thinking was completed 
                sequentially and  efficiently. I was pleasantly surpised in 
                my own abilities in graphic design but nonetheless, I would 
                like to experiment with more metaphorical methods of conveying 
                symbolism with future works of iconography.
