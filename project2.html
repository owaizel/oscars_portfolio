                This project focused on the expression of emotion through text, 
                otherwise known as kinetic typography. I was tasked with selecting a short
                one minute clip with dialogue and animate stylized text over it.
                This was my first time using after effects after all and 
                doing motion graphic animation and it turned out to be a pleaseant experience.

              <p> 
                The scene I chose to depict is an infamous one; often known as the “Buzz Look an Alien” scene. 
                It has become an infamous clip because it has received a reputable amount of “meme worth” all 
                across the Internet. Not only is this clip very meme-worthy but it is also extremely humorous 
                and bound to entice any kind of audience because of its popularity.

              <h4> tutorials time</h4>

              <p> The second stage was all about diving head first into the world of After Effects.
                 I was (and still am) a noob and so the hours of YouTube and Lynda tutorials began right from the get go
                 Both tutorials were virtually all I needed to take on this project. They taught started with the basics of 
                 keyframe animation, layer masking, null-object parenting as well as how to achieve a polished and finished look to all the movements.

              <h3> Step 3</h3>
              <h4>animation process </h4>

              <p> For my animation to look as polished and human like as possible, 
                I used the graph editor a lot to smoothen out the movements of the 
                words coming into the screen. As we saw in lecture, whatever forces 
                are enacted on objects they will react according to friction and gravity. 
                In order to make that experience visual, graph editing was essential in prolonging time,
                 aiding to suspense and anticipation by increasing object velocity, 
                 The exponential curve you see below alters the speed at which the 
                 keyframes animate; it starts fast and ends really slow over time and thus, 
                 this gives your text a smooth entrance and exit instead of entering the 
                 screen with a boring, flat, linear movement.

              <h3> Step 4</h3>
              <h4> designing objects</h4>

              <p> TAs everything in this project had to be original work,
                 I created multiple objects on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to go 
                 along with my animation. This was ALL my own work, though I did look 
                 for inspiration I did not copy a single image. This stage was a finishing
                 touch to the animation and was useful in saving time. Instead of using words
                 to animate I simply used my illustrations to convey the same expression.

              <h3> Step 5</h3>
              <h4> character development</h4>

              <p> In addition to all this, In order to get the character’s to really “speak” to the audience,
                 I realized that colouring the text would not only help differentiate the Buzz and Woody with 
                 one another but it also allows the character ethos to communicate to the audience.My design 
                 choices were also based on the principles of visual composition and hierarchy. 
                 To achieve more emotion through text, different sizing and positioning between 
                 the text was not only important to achieve aesthetic unity, 
                 but also important in conveying to the audience which words were meant to be heard over others.

              <h3> Evaluation</h3>

              <p> In conclusion, Despite all my areas in which I can improve, 
                I was quite impressed with my ability to produce a motion graphic
                 piece that looks professional and worthy of praise (at least my own praise). 
                 Yes, it took an excruciating amount of time to complete but I really learned a 
                 lot about communicating emotion through animation as well as improving my 
                 overall feel for compositional design.
